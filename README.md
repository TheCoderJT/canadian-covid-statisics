## First React Personal Project - Version 1

I started my web dev journey about 8 months ago, started with html, css and javascript.
I then learned about git, npm, node, and api's . I then looked into a frontend framework
and decided to learn about react read their documentation watched free and paid courses ect.

After being stuck in tutorial hell for so long, decided to come up with an idea and create it myself
without a tutorial and this is just that. I wanted to use a free public api and integrate it with react
and display said data of covid-19 in my province.

## Version 2

So, took my learning up another notch aka added material ui to add quick functionality like being able to select any province in canada using their autocomplete function and more
