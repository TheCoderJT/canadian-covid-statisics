## First React Personal Project - Version 1

Version one: Was a personal project from learning react which can be viewed here https://github.com/potasium56/alberta-covid-numbers. 

## Version 2

I decided to make a version where you can look at every province covid data using the same public api that was in my first version. I used materialize-ui to do this since it made it easier to hook up a searchable select which is called AutoComplete.
