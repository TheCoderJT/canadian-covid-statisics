## React Personal Project - Canaidan Province Covid-19 Data

I decided to make a simple website where you can look at every province covid data using a public api from here https://opencovid.ca/ . 
I used materialize-ui for the css framework to better design the website making it eaiser to immplement a multiple selected dropdown and
more.
